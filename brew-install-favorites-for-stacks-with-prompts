#
# Use Homebrew to install our favorite tech-related packages
# that may need to be installed manually because of prompts;
# The prompts may be necessary for passwords, or moving files,
# or more-complex issues that need a human to be involved.
#
# If you're using this file and you find any packages that
# do install without prompts, please let us know by opening
# an issue, or emailing us, or creating a pull request. Thanks!
